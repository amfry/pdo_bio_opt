# Multi-Objective Optimization of Penicillin V under Uncertainity
## Executive Summary

The consistent creation of peniciliin is critical modern life. Increasing demand for antibiotics is driving the annual growth ofthe pharmaceutical industry.(Lee).  Peniciilin V is converted into amoxicillin and amicillin which have general antibiotic properties. 

- Multi-objective otimization between penicillin concentration, profit, production rate, yield
- Stakeholder is pharmaceutical companies & people interested in biological systems modeling
- Monte Carlo of cost parameters
- And/Or introduce uncrtainity in the yield

## Background
### Penicillin Production Model
This is a model of Penicilln V prodcued by the fermentation of the fungus *Penicillium chrysogenum*. The mathemtical model of fermentation used here accounts for production  in 3 celluar types in the fungus. 
### CSTR Model
Continiously Stirred-Tank Reactor are an alternative to fed-batch cultivation  
-This model assumes perfect mixing & a uniform concentration profile
